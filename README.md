Hi, I’m Chintal.

I’m a Junior Software Engineer with experience working on backend systems, internal tooling, and production-grade automation. I enjoy working close to the system, understanding data flows, and building services that behave correctly under real-world constraints.

My background spans startups and enterprise environments, where I’ve worked on backend APIs, async workflows, database-heavy systems, and integrations with third-party services. I’ve spent a lot of time wiring systems together, tracing how data moves through them, and building tools that improve reliability and developer feedback.

### What I work on
- Backend APIs and business logic using Django, Spring Boot, and Node.js  
- Data modeling and query optimization with PostgreSQL and MySQL  
- Async workflows, webhooks, and third-party integrations  
- Internal tooling and developer-facing systems  
- Desktop and systems-style projects using Electron and FFmpeg  

### Current focus
I’m currently building a desktop application that helps capture, trim, annotate, and export time-based video evidence for long-running workflows. The project involves IPC-based architecture, video processing pipelines, and performance-conscious local execution.

### Selected repositories
- **Crowd-Reviews**  
  Backend-focused project using GraphQL, JWT-based auth, and PostgreSQL, with custom middleware and schema design.

I’m actively growing as a software engineer and enjoy working on problems where correctness, ownership, and system design matter.

If you’re interested in the work or want to discuss systems, feel free to reach out.
